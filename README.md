# OK Times Table Practice #

An OK way to practice the times table.

Random mode uses weights extracted from the graph of: http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-28143553 (a very rough approximation of those values). Time table questions range from 2 to 12.

Help/assist (showing the blurred answer after a few seconds) can be disabled with `h` or by clicking the score.

Question mode (random or sequential) can be toggle with `q` or by clicking on the _Random_/_Sequential_ text.

Questions can be skipped with `enter`.

## Know Issues

* Sometimes speech recognition does not start correctly. If that happens just click the "(Not listening.)" text and speech recognition should be restated... which hopefully fixes the problem.
* For some reason, rendering SVGs with blur in Firefox is horribly slow.
* Speech recognition only works in Chrome.
* Speech recognition is off while speech synthesis is speaking, so you will have to wait until speech synthesis ends before you can answer. (But the score timers will not wait for this.)
