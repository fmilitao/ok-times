#OK Times Table Practice#

An OK way to practice the times table. Random mode uses weights somewhat from the graph of: http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-28143553 (more like a very rough approximation). Time table questions range from 2 to 12.

Help/assist (showing the blurred answer after a few seconds) can be disabled with `h` or by clicking the score.

Question mode (random or sequential) can be toggle with `q` or by clicking on the _Random_/_Sequential_ text.

Questions can be skipped with `enter`.
